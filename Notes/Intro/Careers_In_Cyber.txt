    Security Analysis{
            - are explore and evaluate company networks to uncover actionable data and recommendations for engineers to develop 
              preventaive measures. This job role requires working with various stakeholders to gain an understanding of secrurity 
              requirements and the security landscape 

            - Responsibilites:
                - Working with various stakeholders to analyse the cyber security throughout the company
                - Compile ongoing reports about the safety of networks, documenting security issues and measures taken in response
                - Develop security plans, incorporating research on new attack tools and trends, and measures needed across teams to maintain data security.

    Security Engineer {
        - develop and implement security solutions using threats and vulnerability data - often sourced from members of the security workforce.
        - Work accross circumventing a breadth of attacks, including web application attacks, netowrk threats, and evolving trends and tactics.
        - Gaol is to retain and adopt security measures to mitigate the risks of attack and data loss 

        - Responsibilites:
            - Testing and screening security measures across software
            - Monitor networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilities
            - Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security
    }

    
    Incident Responder {
        - Incident responders respond productively and efficiently to security breaches. Responsibilities include creating plans, policies, 
          and protocols for organisations to enact during and following incidents. This is often a highly pressurised position with assessments and responses 
          required in real-time, as attacks are unfolding. Incident response metrics include MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR - the meantime to detect, acknowledge, and 
          recover (from attacks.) The aim is to achieve a swift and effective response, retain financial standing and avoid negative breach implications. 
          Ultimately, incident responders protect the company's data, reputation, and financial standing from cyber attacks.

        - Responsibilites:
            - Developing and adopting a thorough, actionable incident response plan
            - Maintaining strong security best practices and supporting incident response measures
            - Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks, considering learnings and adaptations to take from incidents

    Digital Forensics Examiner {

        - If you like to play detective, this might be the perfect job. If you are working as part of a law-enforcement department, 
          you would be focused on collecting and analysing evidence to help solve crimes: charging the guilty and exonerating the innocent. 
          On the other hand, if your work falls under defending a company's network, you will be using your forensic skills to analyse incidents, 
          such as policy violations.

        - Responsibilites:
            - Collect digital evidence while observing legal procedures
            - Analyse digital evidence to find answers related to the case
            - Document your findings and report on the case
    }

    Malware Analyst {

        - A malware analyst's work involves analysing suspicious programs, discovering what they do and writing reports about their findings. 
          A malware analyst is sometimes called a reverse-engineer as their core task revolves around converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code, 
          usually in a low-level language. This work requires the malware analyst to have a strong programming background, especially in low-level languages such as assembly 
          language and C language. The ultimate goal is to learn about all the activities that a malicious program carries out, find out how to detect it and report it.

        - Responsibilites:
            - Carry out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering
            - Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment
            - Document and report all the findings
    }

    Pen Testing {

        - You may see penetration testing referred to as pentesting and ethical hacking. A penetration tester's job role is to test the security of the systems and 
          software within a company - this is achieved through attempts to uncover flaws and vulnerabilities through systemised hacking. Penetration testers exploit these 
          vulnerabilities to evaluate the risk in each instance. The company can then take these insights to rectify issues to prevent a real-world cyberattack.

        - Responsiblities:
            - Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
            - Perform security assessments, audits, and analyse policies
            - Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention
    }

    Red Teamer {
        - Red teamers share similarities to penetration testers, with a more targeted job role. Penetration testers look to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems 
          to keep cyber-defence in good standing, whilst red teamers are enacted to test the company's detection and response capabilities. This job role requires 
          imitating cyber criminals' actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining access, and avoiding detection. Red team assessments can run for up to a month, 
          typically by a team external to the company. They are often best suited to organisations with mature security programs in place.

        - Responsibilites:
            - Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection
            - Assess organisations' security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures
            - Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances
